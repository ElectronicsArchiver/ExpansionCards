The **Framework Laptop**'s **Expansion Card** system <br>
allows you to choose exactly what ports you want <br>
and on what side they should be.

So far, we have built `USB-C` , `USB-A` , `HDMI` , `DP` , <br>
`MicroSD` cards, as well as a `Storage Expansion` .

However, there are so many more interesting and <br>
useful ways to extend the capabilities of notebooks.

We have released the **CAD** files to make it easier <br>
for you to develop your
own **Expansion Cards**.

Check out the **[Expansion Card Section][Cards]** of the Framework Community for card ideas, support, or just to show off what you're working on.

To apply for funding for prototype fabrication or to list your Expansion Card on the Framework Marketplace, fill out the **[Form][Funding]**.
