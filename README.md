The **Framework Laptop**'s **Expansion Card** system <br>
allows you to choose exactly what ports you want <br>
and on what side they should be.

<br>

So far, we have built `USB-C` , `USB-A` , `HDMI` , `DP` , <br>
`MicroSD` cards, as well as a `Storage Expansion` .

<br>

However, there are so many more interesting and <br>
useful ways to extend the capabilities of notebooks.

<br>

We have released the **CAD** files to make it easier <br>
for you to develop your
own **Expansion Cards**.
