The Framework Laptop's Expansion Card system lets you choose exactly the ports you want and which side you want them on.

We've built `USB-C`, `USB-A`, `HDMI`, `DP`, `MicroSD`, and `Storage Expansion` Cards, but there is an entire world of other interesting ways to extend the capabilities of a notebook.

We're releasing CAD to make it easy for you to develop your
own Expansion Cards.

Check out the **[Expansion Card Section][Cards]** of the Framework Community for card ideas, support, or just to show off what you're working on.

To apply for funding for prototype fabrication or to list your Expansion Card on the Framework Marketplace, fill out the **[Form][Funding]**.
